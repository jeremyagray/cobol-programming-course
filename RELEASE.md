# Release Guidelines

This project is generally a rolling release project (meaning the latest HEAD of master is the current material), but generally it's advised that those looking to leverage these materials in something downstream (such as other training materials or lab environments) pull from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/releases) which makes it easier to see from where the materials are derived.

Releases are cut usually once a week from the current HEAD of master, and provided as markdown files and source code only. If you desire a different format, please refer to the [build instructions](README.md#build).
